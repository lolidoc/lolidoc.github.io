However, it's important to remember that style is subjective and personal preference plays a significant role in determining what is in or out of fashion.</p><p>So, is the pixie cut out of style? The answer is no! While it may not be as prevalent as it once was, the pixie cut continues to be a fashionable and chic choice for those looking to make a bold statement with their hair. Many celebrities, such as Emma Watson and Scarlett Johansson, have rocked the pixie cut in recent years, proving that it can still be a stylish and trendy choice.</p><p>In conclusion, while the pixie cut may not be as popular as it once was, it is far from being out of style.
