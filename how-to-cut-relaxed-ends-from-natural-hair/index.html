Cutting relaxed ends from natural hair can be a daunting task, but with the right technique and knowledge, you can achieve the desired result. In this blog post, we will guide you through the process of how to cut relaxed ends from natural hair, providing you with tips and tricks along the way.</p><p>Many individuals with natural hair struggle with the issue of relaxed ends. These ends can be damaged, dry, and prone to breakage, causing frustration and hindering hair growth. Additionally, the presence of relaxed ends can make it difficult to achieve a cohesive and uniform hairstyle. If you are experiencing these pain points, it may be time to consider cutting your relaxed ends.</p><p>The first step in cutting relaxed ends from natural hair is to ensure that your hair is clean and properly moisturized. This will make it easier to identify the relaxed ends and determine how much needs to be cut. It is also important to have a sharp pair of hair cutting scissors on hand to achieve a clean and precise cut.</p><p>When cutting relaxed ends, start by separating a small section of hair. Gently comb through the section to smooth out any tangles or knots. Once the hair is smooth, hold it between your fingers and run your fingers down the length of the hair. This will help to identify any areas where the hair transitions from natural to relaxed.</p><p>Using the hair cutting scissors, carefully cut off the relaxed ends, making sure to leave the natural hair untouched. It is important to trim off only a small amount at a time to avoid cutting off more than necessary. Additionally, be sure to cut in a straight line to maintain a clean and even appearance.</p><h2>How to Cut Relaxed Ends from Natural Hair: My Personal Experience</h2><p>I have been dealing with relaxed ends in my natural hair for quite some time, and it has always been a struggle to achieve the desired look.
