The sixties were a time of bold and glamorous hairdos that have continued to inspire fashion today. In this blog post, we will guide you on how to do a sixties hairstyle, so you can achieve that vintage look you've always wanted.</p><p>Many people struggle with styling their hair in a sixties-inspired way. They may lack the knowledge or the right tools to achieve the desired look. However, with a few simple steps and some practice, you can easily recreate these classic hairstyles.</p><p>To start, gather the following tools: a teasing comb, hair spray, bobby pins, and a curling iron. These items will be essential in creating volume, curls, and hold for your sixties hairstyle.</p><p>Now, let's break down the process of how to do a sixties hairstyle:</p><h2>Step 1: Start with a Tease</h2><p>Begin by dividing your hair into sections. Take small sections of hair and use a teasing comb to backcomb towards the scalp. This will create volume and texture, which is key in achieving a sixties-inspired look.</p><h2>Step 2: Curl and Pin</h2><p>Next, use a curling iron to curl your hair. Opt for larger barrels to create loose, voluminous curls. Once curled, pin the curls in place using bobby pins. Allow the curls to cool and set before removing the pins.</p><h2>Step 3: Add Volume</h2><p>To add even more volume to your sixties hairstyle, gently brush through the curls with a wide-toothed comb. This will create a soft, voluminous effect that is reminiscent of the era.</p><h2>Step 4: Set with Hair Spray</h2><p>Finally, set your sixties hairstyle with a generous amount of hair spray. This will ensure that your curls stay in place and that your hair has a lasting hold throughout the day or night.</p><p>In conclusion, achieving a sixties hairstyle is all about creating volume, curls, and hold. By following these simple steps and using the right tools, you can easily recreate the iconic hairstyles of the 1960s. So go ahead, embrace your inner retro diva and rock that vintage look!</p><h2>How to Do a Sixties Hairstyle: A Personal Experience</h2><p>As someone who has always been fascinated by the fashion and beauty trends of the past, I was thrilled to try my hand at recreating a sixties hairstyle. I decided to go for the classic beehive look, as it is one of the most iconic hairstyles of the era.</p><p>I started by backcombing my hair at the crown to create height and volume. Then, I used a curling iron to create loose curls throughout the rest of my hair. After pinning the curls in place, I gently brushed through them to create a softer, more natural look.</p><p>Once I was satisfied with the overall shape and volume, I set my hairstyle with a strong-hold hairspray. The final result was a glamorous, retro-inspired look that made me feel like a true sixties fashionista.</p><p>Recreating a sixties hairstyle may take some practice, but with the right tools and techniques, anyone can achieve that vintage look. So why not give it a try? Step back in time and embrace the beauty of the sixties!</p><h2>History and Myth of Sixties Hairstyle</h2><p>The sixties were a time of great social and cultural change, and this was reflected in the hairstyles of the era. Women began to embrace their natural hair texture and experiment with new styles and cuts.</p><p>One of the most iconic hairstyles of the sixties was the beehive. This towering hairstyle was created by backcombing the hair and then smoothing it over to create a rounded, beehive-like shape. It was often adorned with accessories such as headbands or bows.</p><p>Another popular hairstyle of the era was the bouffant. This voluminous style involved teasing the hair at the crown to create height and then smoothing it over to create a sleek, polished look. It was often paired with a headscarf or a decorative hair clip.</p><p>Despite their popularity, these hairstyles required a lot of time and effort to create and maintain. Many women would spend hours styling their hair, using products and tools to achieve the desired look.</p><p>Over time, the hairstyles of the sixties have become synonymous with glamour and femininity. They continue to inspire fashion and beauty trends today, proving that the sixties were truly a golden era for hairstyling.</p><h2>The Hidden Secret of Sixties Hairstyle</h2><p>While achieving a sixties hairstyle may seem daunting, there is a hidden secret that can make the process much easier: hair extensions. By using clip-in or tape-in extensions, you can instantly add length, volume, and texture to your hair, making it easier to recreate those iconic sixties looks.</p><p>Hair extensions can be styled just like your natural hair, so you can curl, tease, and pin them to create the desired shape and volume. They can also be easily removed and reused, making them a versatile and cost-effective option for achieving a sixties hairstyle.</p><p>So if you're struggling to create the perfect beehive or bouffant, consider adding some hair extensions to your styling routine. They will provide you with the extra oomph you need to achieve that authentic sixties look.</p><h2>Recommendation for Achieving a Sixties Hairstyle</h2><p>If you're looking to achieve a sixties hairstyle, it's important to invest in the right tools and products. Here are some recommendations to help you get started:</p><h3>1. Teasing Comb: </h3><p>A teasing comb is essential for creating volume and texture in your hair. Look for one with fine teeth and a pointed handle for precise styling.</p><h3>2. Curling Iron: </h3><p>Choose a curling iron with a larger barrel size to create loose curls. This will give your hairstyle that signature sixties look.</p><h3>3. Bobby Pins: </h3><p>Bobby pins are a must-have for securing your curls and creating the desired shape. Opt for ones that match your hair color for a seamless look.</p><h3>4. Hair Spray: </h3><p>Invest in a high-quality hair spray that offers a strong hold. This will ensure that your sixties hairstyle stays in place all day or night.</p><p>By using these recommended tools and products, you'll be well on your way to achieving a stunning sixties hairstyle.</p><h2>Tips for Perfecting a Sixties Hairstyle</h2><p>While recreating a sixties hairstyle can be a fun and rewarding experience, it does require some patience and practice. Here are some tips to help you perfect your look:</p><h4>1. Start with clean, dry hair: </h4><p>For the best results, make sure your hair is clean and dry before styling. This will ensure that your curls hold and that your hairstyle has longevity.</p><h4>2. Use heat protectant: </h4><p>Before using any heat styling tools, apply a heat protectant spray to your hair.

Keep experimenting and trying new techniques until you achieve the desired look.</p><p>With these tips in mind, you'll be well-equipped to master the art of the sixties hairstyle.</p><h2>Question and Answer: How to Do a Sixties Hairstyle</h2><h3>Q: Can I achieve a sixties hairstyle with short hair?</h3><p>A: While many sixties hairstyles were designed for longer hair, there are still options for those with shorter hair.
