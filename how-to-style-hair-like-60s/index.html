From the beehive to the bouffant, women in the 60s embraced bold and voluminous hairstyles that became synonymous with the era. If you're looking to recreate the glamorous and retro look of 60s hairstyles, you're in the right place. In this article, we'll explore how to style your hair like the 60s and achieve that vintage charm.</p><p>When it comes to styling hair like the 60s, one of the pain points many people face is finding the right techniques and products. The hairstyles of the 60s often required teasing, backcombing, and lots of hairspray to achieve the desired volume and shape. Additionally, finding the right tools and accessories, such as hair rollers and headbands, can also be a challenge.</p><p>To style your hair like the 60s, start by creating the iconic bouffant. This hairstyle involves teasing the hair at the crown to create volume and then smoothing it back to create a rounded shape. You can use a fine-tooth comb or a teasing brush to tease the hair, and then gently smooth it back using a boar bristle brush. Secure the bouffant with bobby pins and finish off with a generous amount of hairspray to hold the style in place.</p><p>In summary, to achieve a 60s-inspired hairstyle, you'll need to tease your hair for volume, create a bouffant shape, and use plenty of hairspray to hold the style. You'll also need to invest in the right tools and accessories, such as hair rollers and headbands, to achieve the desired look.</p><h2>How to Style Hair Like the 60s</h2><p>When it comes to styling your hair like the 60s, there are a few key techniques and styles to keep in mind. Let's dive deeper into each of them:</p><h2>The Bouffant: A Classic 60s Hairstyle</h2><p>The bouffant is perhaps the most iconic hairstyle of the 60s. It involves creating volume at the crown of the head and smoothing the hair back to create a rounded shape. To achieve this look, start by sectioning off the top layer of your hair. Tease the hair at the crown using a fine-tooth comb or teasing brush. Once you've created enough volume, gently smooth the hair back using a boar bristle brush. Secure the bouffant with bobby pins and finish off with hairspray.</p><h2>The Beehive: A Glamorous Updo</h2><p>The beehive is another popular 60s hairstyle that exudes glamour and sophistication. To create a beehive, start by sectioning off the top layer of your hair. Tease the hair at the crown to create volume, and then gently smooth it back using a boar bristle brush. Next, gather the hair at the back of your head and twist it into a bun or chignon. Secure the bun with bobby pins and use hairspray to hold it in place. Finish off the look by adding a headband or hair accessory for extra flair.</p><h2>The Pixie Cut: A Short and Chic Style</h2><p>The pixie cut gained popularity in the 60s and continues to be a trendy hairstyle today. To achieve the 60s-inspired pixie cut, start by cutting your hair into a short and layered style. Use a flat iron or curling iron to add texture and volume to your hair. Finish off with a texturizing spray or pomade to enhance the retro vibe.</p><h2>The Flip: A Fun and Flirty Look</h2><p>The flip is a playful and flirty hairstyle that was popular in the 60s. To create the flip, start by blow-drying your hair with a round brush to add volume and smoothness. Once your hair is dry, use a flat iron or curling iron to curl the ends of your hair outward. Finish off with a light hairspray to hold the style in place.</p><h3>Tips for Styling Hair Like the 60s</h3><p>Here are some additional tips to help you achieve the perfect 60s hairstyle:</p><p>1. Use a good quality teasing brush or fine-tooth comb for creating volume.</p><p>2. Invest in a boar bristle brush for smoothing and shaping your hair.</p><p>3. Experiment with different sizes of rollers to achieve different levels of volume and curl.</p><p>4. Don't be afraid to use hairspray to hold your style in place. The 60s hairstyles were all about big and bold looks.</p><h4>Question and Answer</h4><p>Q: Can I achieve a 60s hairstyle with short hair?</p><p>A: Absolutely! While many 60s hairstyles were known for their voluminous and long styles, there are plenty of options for those with short hair. The pixie cut, for example, was a popular choice in the 60s and continues to be a trendy and retro hairstyle today.</p><p>Q: Are there any specific products I should use for styling my hair like the 60s?</p><p>A: For creating volume and hold, you'll definitely want to invest in a good quality hairspray. Look for one that provides a strong hold without leaving your hair stiff or sticky. Additionally, a texturizing spray or pomade can help add texture and enhance the retro vibe of your hairstyle.</p><p>Q: Can I achieve a 60s hairstyle without using heat styling tools?</p><p>A: Yes, it is possible to achieve a 60s-inspired hairstyle without using heat styling tools. Instead of curling your hair with a curling iron, you can try using foam rollers or pin curls to create soft and voluminous curls. There are also heatless techniques for creating volume, such as backcombing or using a volumizing mousse.</p><p>Q: How long does it take to style hair like the 60s?</p><p>A: The time it takes to style your hair like the 60s will depend on your hair length, texture, and the specific style you're going for. Generally, it may take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour to achieve a 60s-inspired hairstyle.</p><h2>Conclusion of How to Style Hair Like the 60s</h2><p>Styling your hair like the 60s is a fun and nostalgic way to embrace retro fashion and beauty. Whether you opt for the iconic bouffant, the glamorous beehive, or the playful flip, you can channel the spirit of the 60s and add a touch of vintage charm to your look. With the right techniques, tools, and products, you'll be able to achieve a 60s-inspired hairstyle that turns heads and captures the essence of the era.</p></article>
