Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner specifically formulated for thick, wavy hair. These products will help to nourish and hydrate your hair, reducing frizz and enhancing your natural waves.</p><p>2. Avoid washing your hair every day, as this can strip away natural oils and lead to further frizz. Instead, opt for every other day or every few days, depending on your hair's needs.</p><p>3. When conditioning your hair, focus on the mid-lengths and ends, as these are the areas that tend to be drier and more prone to frizz. Avoid applying conditioner to your scalp, as this can weigh down your hair and make it appear greasy.</p><p>4. After washing your hair, gently squeeze out excess water using a microfiber towel or an old t-shirt. Avoid rubbing your hair vigorously with a towel, as this can cause frizz and breakage.</p><p>5. Apply a leave-in conditioner or a lightweight styling cream to damp hair to help smooth the cuticles and reduce frizz. Be sure to distribute the product evenly throughout your hair, focusing on the mid-lengths and ends.</p><p>6. Use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to detangle your hair gently. Start from the ends and work your way up to the roots, being careful not to pull or tug on your hair.</p><p>7. Avoid using heat styling tools, such as flat irons and curling irons, on a daily basis. Excessive heat can damage your hair and make it more prone to frizz. Instead, embrace your natural waves and opt for heatless styling techniques, such as braiding or air-drying.</p><p>8. If you do use heat styling tools, be sure to apply a heat protectant spray or serum beforehand. This will help to minimize damage and protect your hair from the high temperatures.</p><p>9. Consider getting regular trims to remove split ends and keep your hair looking healthy. This will also help to prevent further breakage and reduce frizz.</p><p>10. Embrace natural hairstyles that work well with your hair type. Experiment with different styles, such as braids, buns, and updos, to find what works best for you.</p><h4>Conclusion of what to do with thick wavy frizzy hair</h4><p>Dealing with thick wavy frizzy hair can be a challenge, but with the right products and techniques, you can achieve the desired look.
