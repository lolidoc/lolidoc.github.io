Moisturize your hair: Before braiding, make sure to moisturize your hair to prevent dryness and breakage. Use a leave-in conditioner or hair oil to keep your hair hydrated and healthy.</p><p>2. Protect your edges: When braiding, be gentle with your edges to avoid pulling and breakage. Consider using edge control or a soft brush to smooth down your edges and protect them from tension.</p><p>3.

You can also use a braid spray or serum to help smooth down any flyaways.</p><h2>Conclusion of Cute Braided Hairstyles for Short African American Hair</h2><p>Cute braided hairstyles for short African American hair are a fantastic way to showcase your personal style and embrace your natural hair texture.
