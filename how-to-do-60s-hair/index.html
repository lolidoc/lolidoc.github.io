Whether you're dressing up for a themed party or simply want to try out a retro hairstyle, learning how to do 60s hair can give you that vintage glam you desire. In this blog post, we'll guide you through the process of achieving this classic hairstyle and share some tips and tricks to make it easier.</p><p>The 60s era was known for its bold and glamorous hairstyles. Women in the 60s embraced voluminous hair, big curls, and stylish updos. However, recreating these hairstyles can be a challenge if you're not familiar with the techniques and tools involved. That's where our guide on how to do 60s hair comes in handy.</p><p>To achieve the 60s hair look, you'll need a few essential tools and products. Start by gathering a teasing comb, hot rollers or a curling iron, hairspray, and bobby pins. These items will help you create the volume, curls, and hold necessary for 60s-inspired hairstyles.</p><h2>How to do 60s Hair: Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Step 1: Start by washing and conditioning your hair. Apply a volumizing mousse or spray to add extra volume to your roots.</p><p>Step 2: Use a teasing comb to backcomb the hair at the crown of your head. This will create the desired volume and height for your 60s hairstyle.</p><p>Step 3: Section your hair and curl it using hot rollers or a curling iron. For an authentic 60s look, aim for loose, big curls rather than tight ones.</p><p>Step 4: Once your curls have cooled down, gently brush them out to create soft waves. Use your fingers or a wide-toothed comb to maintain the volume and texture.</p><p>Step 5: Depending on the hairstyle you're going for, you can either leave your hair down or pull it up into an updo. Secure your hair with bobby pins and use hairspray to set the style in place.</p><h2>History and Myth of 60s Hair</h2><p>The 60s were a time of significant cultural change, and hairstyles played a big role in expressing individuality and rebellion. Women started experimenting with their hair, embracing natural textures and creating unique looks. The iconic bouffant hairstyle became popular during this time, characterized by its high volume and backcombing techniques.</p><p>One common myth associated with 60s hair is that women used hairspray extensively to achieve their desired looks. While hairspray was undoubtedly a staple product, many women also relied on teasing and backcombing techniques to create volume and structure without excessive use of hairspray.</p><h2>The Hidden Secret of 60s Hair</h2><p>The hidden secret behind achieving the perfect 60s hair lies in the art of teasing and backcombing. These techniques create the volume and height necessary for the iconic hairstyles of the era. By teasing the hair at the roots and combing it upwards, you can achieve the signature 60s look.</p><h2>Recommendation for 60s Hair</h2><p>When it comes to 60s hair, it's essential to choose the right products and tools. Opt for a high-quality teasing comb and invest in a good hairspray that provides hold without making your hair stiff or sticky. Additionally, using hot rollers or a curling iron with a larger barrel size will help you create those loose, 60s-style curls.</p><h3>More Tips on How to do 60s Hair</h3><p>1. Start with clean, dry hair to ensure your styles last longer. 2. Use a heat protectant spray before using hot tools to prevent damage. 3. Experiment with different hairstyles like the beehive, half-up bouffant, or the classic long loose waves. 4. Don't be afraid to accessorize with headbands, scarves, or statement hair clips to add an extra touch of 60s flair.</p><h4>Fun Facts about 60s Hair</h4><p>Did you know that the beehive hairstyle, popularized by iconic figures like Audrey Hepburn and Brigitte Bardot, was named after its resemblance to a beehive? This iconic style was created by backcombing the hair to create height and then smoothing it down to create a rounded shape.</p><h2>How to do 60s Hair: Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Step 1: Start by washing and conditioning your hair. Apply a volumizing mousse or spray to add extra volume to your roots.</p><p>Step 2: Use a teasing comb to backcomb the hair at the crown of your head. This will create the desired volume and height for your 60s hairstyle.</p><p>Step 3: Section your hair and curl it using hot rollers or a curling iron. For an authentic 60s look, aim for loose, big curls rather than tight ones.</p><p>Step 4: Once your curls have cooled down, gently brush them out to create soft waves. Use your fingers or a wide-toothed comb to maintain the volume and texture.</p><p>Step 5: Depending on the hairstyle you're going for, you can either leave your hair down or pull it up into an updo. Secure your hair with bobby pins and use hairspray to set the style in place.</p><h2>What If You're Short on Time?</h2><p>If you're short on time but still want to achieve a 60s-inspired hairstyle, you can opt for a quick and easy half-up bouffant. Simply follow the steps below:</p><p>Step 1: Tease the hair at the crown of your head to create volume.</p><p>Step 2: Take a small section of hair from each side of your head and bring it towards the back, securing it with bobby pins.</p><p>Step 3: Gently brush out the rest of your hair to create soft waves.</p><p>Step 4: Finish off with a spritz of hairspray to hold the style in place.</p><h2>Listicle: 5 Must-Try 60s Hairstyles</h2><p>1. The Bouffant: Achieve the ultimate 60s glam with this high-volume hairstyle. Tease the hair at the crown and use bobby pins to create a rounded shape.</p><p>2. The Beehive: This iconic hairstyle is perfect for special occasions. Backcomb the hair at the crown and shape it into a beehive-like structure.</p><p>3. The Twiggy Pixie: Embrace the iconic 60s supermodel look with a short, pixie haircut. Keep the hair sleek and styled close to the head.</p><p>4. The Long Loose Waves: For a more relaxed 60s look, opt for long, loose waves. Curl the hair using hot rollers or a curling iron and brush out for soft waves.</p><p>5. The Half-Up Bouffant: This hairstyle combines the elegance of an updo with the volume of a bouffant. Tease the hair at the crown and secure half of it up, leaving the rest down.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p>Q: Can I achieve 60s hair with short hair?</p><p>A: While some 60s hairstyles are more suitable for longer hair, there are still options for those with short hair. Consider trying a Twiggy-inspired pixie cut or experimenting with accessories like headbands and scarves.</p><p>Q: Will teasing damage my hair?</p><p>A: Teasing can cause some temporary damage, but as long as you're gentle and use the right tools, the effects should be minimal. Make sure to use a wide-toothed comb or a teasing brush specifically designed for backcombing.</p><p>Q: How long will 60s hairstyles last?</p><p>A: The longevity of your 60s hairstyle will depend on various factors, including your hair type, the products you use, and the style itself. Using a strong-hold hairspray and securing your style with bobby pins can help it last longer.</p><p>Q: Can I achieve 60s hair without heat styling?</p><p>A: While heat styling can help create those signature 60s curls, you can also achieve a similar look using alternative methods like foam rollers or overnight braids. Experiment with different techniques to find what works best for your hair.</p><h2>Conclusion of How to do 60s Hair</h2><p>With the right tools, techniques, and a little practice, you can achieve the iconic 60s hair look. Whether you're going for a glamorous bouffant or a casual half-up bouffant, these hairstyles will surely add a touch of vintage charm to your overall look. Remember to have fun and experiment with different styles to find the one that suits you best. So go ahead, embrace the retro vibes, and rock that 60s hairstyle!</p></article>
