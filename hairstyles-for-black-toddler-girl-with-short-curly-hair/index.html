It's important for black toddler girls to see themselves represented in the media and to feel proud of their unique hair texture.</p><p>Historically, there has been a lack of representation and understanding when it comes to black hair. Many black women and girls have felt pressure to conform to Eurocentric beauty standards and have been told that their natural hair is unprofessional or unkempt.
