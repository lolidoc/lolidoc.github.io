In this article, we will guide you through the process and provide tips and recommendations to help you achieve the perfect spiky style.</p><p>When it comes to cutting women's short spiky hair, there are a few key points to keep in mind. First, you'll need the right tools, including sharp scissors and a fine-toothed comb.
