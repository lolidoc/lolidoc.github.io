Finding the right hairstyle can be a challenge, but don't worry! In this blog post, we will discuss the best hairstyles for square faces over 50, and help you find a look that flatters your features and makes you feel confident and beautiful.</p><p>As we age, our faces change and our features become more defined. This can make it difficult to find a hairstyle that complements our face shape and enhances our natural beauty. Many women with square faces over 50 struggle with finding a hairstyle that softens their jawline and adds femininity to their overall look.</p><p>The best hairstyle for a square face over 50 is one that adds softness and balance to the angular features. This can be achieved through layers, waves, or curls that soften the jawline and draw attention to the eyes and cheekbones. Avoid hairstyles that are too angular or severe, as they can make the face appear harsh and aging.</p><h2>Personal Experience with Best Hairstyle for Square Face Over 50</h2><p>As a woman over 50 with a square face shape, I understand the struggle of finding the right hairstyle. For years, I stuck with a short, straight bob that did nothing to flatter my features. It wasn't until I found a hairstylist who understood the nuances of my face shape that I discovered the power of layers and waves.</p><p>Layers and waves add movement and softness to my square face, making it appear more youthful and feminine. They also draw attention away from my jawline and highlight my eyes and cheekbones. I now wear my hair in a shoulder-length style with face-framing layers and loose waves, and I couldn't be happier with the results.</p><h2>What is the Best Hairstyle for Square Face Over 50?</h2><p>The best hairstyle for a square face over 50 is one that adds softness and balance to the angular features. This can be achieved through layers, waves, or curls that soften the jawline and draw attention to the eyes and cheekbones. Here are some key points to keep in mind:</p><h3>Layers:</h3><p>Adding layers to your hair can create movement and softness, making your square face appear more feminine. Opt for face-framing layers that start around the cheekbones and blend into the rest of your hair. This will draw attention to your best features and soften the angles of your face.</p><h3>Waves and Curls:</h3><p>Waves and curls can also soften the jawline and add femininity to a square face. Use a curling iron or hot rollers to create loose waves or curls, and finish with a light-hold hairspray to keep them in place. This will add volume and movement to your hair, making it appear more youthful and vibrant.</p><h3>Short or Medium Length:</h3><p>Short or medium-length hairstyles are often the most flattering for square faces over 50. Avoid hairstyles that are too long, as they can drag down the face and make it appear heavier. Instead, opt for a shoulder-length cut or a short bob that hits just below the jawline. This will create balance and proportion, making your face appear more youthful and balanced.</p><h2>The History and Myth of Best Hairstyle for Square Face Over 50</h2><p>The idea of finding the best hairstyle for a square face over 50 is not a new concept.

This myth has led many women with square faces to believe that they cannot wear certain hairstyles or that they are limited in their options. However, this is simply not true. With the right cut and styling techniques, any woman can find a hairstyle that flatters her square face and enhances her natural beauty.</p><h2>The Hidden Secret of Best Hairstyle for Square Face Over 50</h2><p>The hidden secret to finding the best hairstyle for a square face over 50 is to work with a skilled hairstylist who understands your unique face shape and features.
