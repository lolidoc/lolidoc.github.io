Once your hair is dry, comb it through to remove any tangles or knots.</p><p>Step 2: Section Off Your Hair</p><p>Next, use hair clips to section off your hair. Start by creating a part down the center of your head, from your forehead to the nape of your neck. Then, use hair clips to separate the front and back sections of your hair.</p><p>Step 3: Start Cutting</p><p>Once your hair is sectioned off, you can begin cutting. Start with the back section of your hair, as this will be the shortest. Use your comb to comb through a small section of hair, then hold the ends between your fingers and cut straight across. Continue this process, working your way from the back to the front of your head.</p><p>Step 4: Style Your Hair</p><p>After you have finished cutting your hair, you can move on to styling. There are many different ways to style short hair, depending on your desired look. You can use a flat iron or curling iron to add texture and volume, or you can use styling products such as mousse or hairspray to hold your style in place.
