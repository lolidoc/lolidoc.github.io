Additionally, many women over 60 may have specific concerns such as thinning hair or a desire for low-maintenance styles. It's important to find a hairstyle that addresses these pain points and enhances your natural beauty.</p><p>When it comes to best hairstyles for wavy hair over 60, there are a few key factors to consider.
