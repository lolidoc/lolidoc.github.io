Not only do they enhance my natural waves, but they also make styling a breeze.</p><p>One of my favorite medium haircuts for wavy hair in 2020 is the long bob, also known as the "lob." This style hits just below the shoulders and features subtle layers that add movement and definition to my waves. I love how versatile this haircut is, allowing me to wear my hair straight or embrace my natural waves without much effort.</p><p>Another medium haircut for wavy hair that I have tried and loved is the shag cut.

In ancient Greece, women with wavy hair were admired and often seen as goddess-like. They would often adorn their wavy locks with flowers and ribbons to accentuate their natural texture.</p><p>Throughout history, wavy hair has been associated with romance and allure. In the Victorian era, women would use hot curling irons and rags to create waves in their hair, as straight hair was considered less desirable. This trend continued into the early 20th century, where finger waves became popular among flapper girls.</p><p>Despite the long-standing admiration for wavy hair, there have also been myths and misconceptions surrounding this hair type. One common myth is that wavy hair is unmanageable and difficult to style. However, with the right haircut and styling techniques, wavy hair can be easily tamed and styled to perfection.</p><p>Another myth about wavy hair is that it lacks volume. While it may be true that wavy hair is prone to frizz and can appear flat when not properly cared for, with the right haircut and products, you can achieve volume and definition that will make your waves the envy of others.</p><h2>Hidden Secrets of Medium Haircuts for Wavy Hair 2020</h2><p>One of the hidden secrets of medium haircuts for wavy hair in 2020 is the power of layers. By adding layers to your hair, you can enhance your natural waves and create movement and dimension. Layers also help to reduce bulk and weight, making your waves more manageable and defined.</p><p>Another hidden secret is the importance of the right products and styling techniques. Using a curl-enhancing shampoo and conditioner, as well as a lightweight styling product, can help to define your waves and reduce frizz. Additionally, using a diffuser when blow-drying your hair can help to enhance your natural texture and create bouncy, voluminous waves.</p><p>Lastly, embracing your natural texture is key to achieving the perfect medium haircut for wavy hair in 2020. Instead of fighting against your waves, embrace them and work with them. This will not only make styling easier but also result in a more natural and effortless look.</p><h2>Recommendations for Medium Haircuts for Wavy Hair 2020</h2><p>When it comes to medium haircuts for wavy hair in 2020, there are a few styles that are highly recommended. The long bob, or lob, is a popular choice as it is versatile and suits a variety of face shapes. The shag cut is another recommended style, as it adds volume and texture to wavy hair.
