Well, you're in luck! In this blog post, we will provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to achieve the perfect space buns with long, thick hair. Whether you're getting ready for a festival, a workout, or just want to switch up your hairstyle, space buns are a fun and trendy option. So, let's get started and learn how to create space buns with long, thick hair!</p><p>Many people with long, thick hair often find it challenging to create space buns that stay in place and look neat. The weight and volume of the hair can make it difficult to achieve the desired bun shape and secure it properly. Additionally, long, thick hair can be more prone to frizz and flyaways, which can affect the overall look of the space buns. However, with the right techniques and products, you can overcome these challenges and create stunning space buns.</p><p>To create space buns with long, thick hair, follow these steps:</p><h2>Step 1: Prep Your Hair</h2><p>Start by washing and conditioning your hair with products suitable for your hair type. Apply a leave-in conditioner or a heat protectant spray to protect your hair from heat damage if you plan to use hot tools.</p><h2>Step 2: Divide Your Hair</h2><p>Using a comb, create a center part to divide your hair into two equal sections. Secure each section with hair ties to keep them separate.</p><h2>Step 3: Create the Buns</h2><p>Working with one section at a time, twist the hair in a clockwise direction until it starts to coil around itself. Continue twisting until the hair forms a bun shape. Secure the bun with bobby pins, making sure to anchor them firmly into the base of the bun. Repeat this step with the other section of hair.</p><h2>Step 4: Secure and Style</h2><p>Once both buns are in place, use bobby pins to secure any loose or stray hairs. You can also use hairspray or a styling gel to smooth down any frizz or flyaways. If desired, you can add accessories like ribbons, scrunchies, or glitter to enhance the look of your space buns.</p><p>In conclusion, creating space buns with long, thick hair can be challenging, but with the right techniques and products, you can achieve the perfect bun. Follow the steps outlined in this blog post to create stunning space buns that stay in place and look stylish. Don't be afraid to experiment with different accessories and styles to make your space buns unique to you. So, go ahead and rock those space buns with your long, thick hair!</p><h2>How to Do Space Buns with Long Thick Hair: A Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Creating space buns with long, thick hair can be a bit challenging, but with the right techniques, you can achieve the perfect look. In this section, I will share my personal experience with creating space buns and provide more detailed instructions on how to do it with long, thick hair.</p><p>When I first attempted to create space buns with my long, thick hair, I struggled to keep them in place and make them look neat. The weight of my hair would often cause the buns to sag or slide down, and I would end up with a messy hairstyle. However, after some trial and error, I discovered a few tips and tricks that helped me achieve the desired look.</p><h2>Prepping Your Hair</h2><p>Before creating space buns, it's important to prep your hair properly. Start by washing and conditioning your hair with products suitable for your hair type. Long, thick hair can be prone to dryness, so make sure to use a hydrating conditioner to keep your hair moisturized. After washing, gently towel dry your hair to remove excess water, but avoid rubbing it vigorously as this can cause frizz.</p><p>Next, apply a leave-in conditioner or a heat protectant spray to protect your hair from heat damage if you plan to use hot tools. Long, thick hair can take longer to dry, so it's best to let it air dry or use a diffuser attachment on your hairdryer to minimize heat exposure.</p><h2>Dividing Your Hair</h2><p>Creating a clean and even part is crucial for achieving symmetrical space buns. Using a comb, divide your hair into two equal sections by creating a center part. Make sure the part is straight and extends from your forehead to the nape of your neck. You can use clips or hair ties to keep each section separate and prevent them from getting mixed up.</p><h2>Creating the Buns</h2><p>Now it's time to create the buns. Start with one section of hair and work with it separately. Take the hair and twist it in a clockwise direction until it starts to coil around itself. Continue twisting until the hair forms a bun shape. The tighter the twist, the neater the bun will look. Secure the bun with bobby pins, making sure to anchor them firmly into the base of the bun. Repeat this step with the other section of hair.</p><h2>Securing and Styling</h2><p>Once both buns are in place, take a moment to ensure they are secure and symmetrical. Use bobby pins to secure any loose or stray hairs, tucking them into the buns. If you have any frizz or flyaways, you can use hairspray, a styling gel, or a smoothing serum to tame them down. Apply the product sparingly to avoid weighing down your hair or making it look greasy.</p><p>If you want to add some extra flair to your space buns, you can experiment with different accessories. Ribbons, scrunchies, and glitter can all be used to enhance the look and make your space buns unique to your style.</p><h3>How to Do Space Buns with Long Thick Hair: Tips and Tricks</h3><p>Here are some additional tips and tricks to help you achieve the perfect space buns with long, thick hair:</p><ul><li>Use texturizing spray or dry shampoo to add grip and hold to your hair before creating the buns.</li><li>For a sleeker look, you can straighten your hair before creating the buns.</li><li>Experiment with different parting styles, such as a side part or a zigzag part, to change up the look of your space buns.</li><li>If you have layers in your hair, use bobby pins to secure them into the buns for a more polished appearance.</li><li>Don't be afraid to play around with the size and placement of the buns. You can create smaller, more compact buns or larger, more voluminous ones.</li><li>Have fun with accessories! Try adding flowers, beads, or colorful hair extensions to your space buns for a unique and festive look.</li></ul><h4>How to Do Space Buns with Long Thick Hair: Frequently Asked Questions</h4><p>Q: Can I create space buns with long, thick hair without using bobby pins?</p><p>A: While bobby pins are the most common and secure way to hold space buns in place, you can also try using hair elastics or hair claws to create the buns. However, keep in mind that these methods may not provide as much stability and may be more prone to slipping.</p><p>Q: How long does it take to create space buns with long, thick hair?</p><p>A: The time it takes to create space buns with long, thick hair can vary depending on your skill level and the complexity of the hairstyle. On average, it can take anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes to create space buns. With practice, you'll become faster and more efficient at styling your hair.</p><p>Q: Can I create space buns with long, thick hair if I have layers or bangs?</p><p>A: Yes, you can still create space buns with long, thick hair even if you have layers or bangs. Simply incorporate the shorter pieces of hair into the buns and use bobby pins to secure them in place. For bangs, you can choose to leave them out or incorporate them into the buns for a more cohesive look.</p><p>Q: How do I make my space buns last longer?</p><p>A: To make your space buns last longer, make sure to secure them tightly with bobby pins and use hairspray or a styling gel to tame any flyaways. You can also choose to create the buns on second-day hair, as the natural oils in your hair can help add grip and hold. Additionally, avoid excessive touching or pulling on the buns throughout the day to prevent them from loosening.</p><h2>Conclusion of How to Do Space Buns with Long Thick Hair</h2><p>Creating space buns with long, thick hair may require a bit of patience and practice, but with the right techniques and products, you can achieve a stylish and trendy look. Follow the step-by-step guide and tips outlined in this blog post to create stunning space buns that stay in place and complement your long, thick hair.
