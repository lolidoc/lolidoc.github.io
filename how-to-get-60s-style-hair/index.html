Look no further! In this blog post, we will guide you on how to get 60s style hair and achieve that timeless, vintage look that never goes out of style.</p><p>The 60s was a decade known for its bold and glamorous hairstyles. From the iconic beehive to the sleek mod bob, there are plenty of options to choose from. However, achieving these styles can be tricky if you don't know where to start.</p><p>To get 60s style hair, you'll need to follow a few key steps. First, start with the right haircut. Whether you're going for a short bob or long, flowing locks, make sure to consult with a hairstylist who specializes in vintage hairstyles. They will be able to give you the perfect cut to achieve your desired look.</p><p>Next, you'll need to invest in the right styling products. Back in the 60s, hairspray was a staple for keeping hairstyles in place. Look for a strong hold hairspray that will keep your hair in place all day long. You'll also need a teasing comb and some bobby pins to create the volume and shape that was popular in the 60s.</p><h2>Personal Experience with 60s Style Hair</h2><p>As someone who loves all things vintage, I have always been fascinated by the 60s style hair. I decided to give it a try for a special event and was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to achieve. I started by getting a bob haircut with some layers to add texture. Then, I used a teasing comb to create volume at the crown of my head. After that, I pinned up the sides of my hair to create a sleek and polished look. Finally, I finished off with a generous amount of hairspray to keep everything in place. The end result was a fabulous 60s-inspired hairstyle that turned heads all night long!</p><h2>What is 60s Style Hair?</h2><p>60s style hair refers to the hairstyles that were popular during the 1960s. This decade was known for its variety of hairstyles, from the sophisticated bouffant to the edgy pixie cut. Women in the 60s often wore their hair in voluminous styles with lots of height at the crown, and sleek, polished looks were also popular. The hairstyles of the 60s were often characterized by their boldness and glamour.</p><h2>History and Myth of 60s Style Hair</h2><p>The 60s was a time of great social and cultural change, and hairstyles reflected this. Women in the 60s were breaking free from traditional gender roles and expressing themselves through their hair. The beehive, for example, was a popular style that symbolized women's liberation and empowerment. However, not all hairstyles of the 60s were as glamorous as they seemed. Many women spent hours in the salon getting their hair teased and styled, and some even resorted to using wigs and hairpieces to achieve the desired look.</p><h2>The Hidden Secret of 60s Style Hair</h2><p>The hidden secret to achieving 60s style hair lies in the art of teasing. Teasing, also known as backcombing, involves gently combing the hair in the opposite direction to create volume and height. This technique was commonly used in the 60s to achieve the iconic bouffant and beehive hairstyles. To tease your hair, start by sectioning off a small section at the crown of your head. Then, hold the hair up and gently comb downwards towards the scalp. Repeat this process until you have achieved the desired volume. Finally, smooth the top layer of hair over the teased section and secure with bobby pins.</p><h2>Recommended Products for 60s Style Hair</h2><p>To achieve the perfect 60s style hair, there are a few products that we recommend. First, invest in a high-quality hairspray with a strong hold. Look for a product that will keep your hair in place all day without weighing it down. Next, a teasing comb is essential for creating volume and height. Finally, don't forget the bobby pins! These will come in handy for securing your hair in place and creating the desired shape.</p><h3>Tips for Achieving 60s Style Hair</h3><p>Here are a few tips to help you achieve the perfect 60s style hair:</p><ol><li>Start with the right haircut.
