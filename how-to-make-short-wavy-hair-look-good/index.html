It can be difficult to find the right products and techniques that work for your hair type. Additionally, short hair can sometimes be harder to manage and style compared to longer hair. But fear not, with the right knowledge and tools, you can enhance your short wavy hair and make it look fabulous!</p><p>To make short wavy hair look good, it's important to start with a good haircut. Opt for a cut that takes into consideration your natural wave pattern and works with it, rather than against it.
