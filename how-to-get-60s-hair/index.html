Once you have chosen your desired look, you can start gathering the necessary tools and products to achieve it.</p><p>In summary, here are the main points to keep in mind when trying to achieve a 60s hairstyle:</p><h2>How to Get 60s Hair: Explained</h2><p>To truly understand how to get 60s hair, it's important to dive into the history and myth surrounding this iconic era. The 1960s were a time of revolution and self-expression, and the hairstyles of the time reflected this spirit. From the beehive to the pixie cut, each style represented a different facet of the cultural and societal changes happening during that time.</p><h2>History and Myth of 60s Hair</h2><p>One of the hidden secrets of achieving 60s hair is using the right products and techniques. Back in the day, hairspray and backcombing were essential for creating the iconic volume and height of the beehive and bouffant. Additionally, hot rollers and curling irons were used to achieve the perfect curls and waves.</p><h2>Recommended Products for 60s Hair</h2><p>If you're looking to recreate a 60s hairstyle, we recommend using the following products:</p><h3>Hairspray:</h3><p>Hairspray is essential for holding your style in place and adding extra volume. Look for a strong-hold hairspray that won't weigh your hair down.</p><h3>Teasing Comb:</h3><p>A teasing comb is perfect for creating volume and height. Use it to backcomb your hair at the roots to achieve the iconic 60s look.</p><h3>Hot Rollers:</h3><p>To create soft curls or waves, hot rollers are a must-have. They provide long-lasting results and are easy to use.</p><h2>Tips for Achieving 60s Hair</h2><p>To help you achieve the perfect 60s hairstyle, here are some tips to keep in mind:</p><h4>1. Start with clean, dry hair:</h4><p>Before styling, make sure your hair is clean and dry. This will help the products and tools adhere better to your hair and allow for a longer-lasting style.</p><h4>2. Use heat protectant:</h4><p>If you're using hot rollers or a curling iron, remember to apply a heat protectant spray to prevent damage to your hair.</p><h4>3. Backcomb for volume:</h4><p>To create the voluminous looks of the 60s, backcomb your hair at the roots using a teasing comb. This will add instant height and body.</p><h4>4. Finish with hairspray:</h4><p>To ensure your style stays in place all day, finish with a generous amount of hairspray. This will help lock in your look and prevent any flyaways.</p><h2>Fun Facts about 60s Hair</h2><p>Did you know that the beehive hairstyle was created by Chicago-based hairdresser Margaret Vinci Heldt in 1960? She was inspired by a velvet fez hat and wanted to create a hairstyle that would accommodate it. The beehive quickly gained popularity and became one of the most iconic looks of the era.</p><h2>How to Get 60s Hair: Step-by-Step</h2><p>Now that you have a better understanding of how to achieve 60s hair, let's break it down into a step-by-step guide:</p><h2>What If You're Short on Time?</h2><p>If you're short on time but still want to achieve a 60s-inspired look, there are a few shortcuts you can try:</p><h2>Listicle: 10 Easy 60s-Inspired Hairstyles</h2><p>If you're looking for some inspiration, here is a listicle of 10 easy 60s-inspired hairstyles:</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><h3>Q: Can I achieve 60s hair with short hair?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can still achieve a 60s-inspired look with short hair.
