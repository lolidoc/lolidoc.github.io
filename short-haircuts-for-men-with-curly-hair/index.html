The contrast between the short sides and the longer curls creates a dramatic and eye-catching look.</p><h3>3. Classic Fade:</h3><p>A classic fade is a timeless choice for men with curly hair. This style involves gradually tapering the hair on the sides and back, creating a seamless transition from short to long. The hair on top can be left slightly longer to showcase the curls.</p><h3>4. Buzz Cut:</h3><p>A buzz cut is a low-maintenance option for men with curly hair. This style involves cutting the hair very short all over, creating a clean and polished look.
