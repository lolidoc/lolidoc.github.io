Thick hair can be a challenge to style, but with the right techniques and products, you can achieve any look you desire. Opt for a shorter haircut with layers to reduce the bulk and add movement to your hair. Use a volumizing mousse or spray to add volume and texture, and experiment with different styling techniques to find the one that works best for your hair type.</p><h3>Q: How often should I wash my short hair?</h3><p>A: The frequency of washing your short hair depends on your hair type and personal preference. If you have oily hair, you may need to wash it more frequently to keep it looking clean and fresh. On the other hand, if you have dry hair, you may prefer to wash it less often to prevent it from becoming stripped of its natural oils. As a general rule, aim to wash your short hair every 2-3 days, or as needed.</p><h3>Q: Can I still wear my short hair in an updo?</h3><p>A: Absolutely! Short hair can be styled in a variety of updos, depending on the length and texture of your hair. You can try a sleek and polished updo, a messy and textured updo, or a half-up, half-down style. Experiment with different techniques and accessories, such as bobby pins and hair ties, to create the perfect updo for any occasion.</p><h3>Q: How do I prevent my short hair from looking flat?</h3><p>A: To prevent your short hair from looking flat, there are a few tricks you can try. First, use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner to add volume and texture to your hair. Second, use a texturizing spray or powder to add texture and movement to your hair. Third, try backcombing or teasing your hair at the roots to add height and volume. Finally, experiment with different styling techniques, such as curling or straightening, to create volume and dimension in your short hair.</p><h2>Conclusion of what are the best short haircuts for 2021:</h2><p>In conclusion, the best short haircuts for 2021 are the pixie cut, bob, shag, and pompadour. These haircuts are versatile, stylish, and perfect for anyone who wants to make a statement with their short hair.
