Start with clean, towel-dried hair: Apply the mousse to damp hair for best results. This will allow the product to distribute evenly throughout the hair and provide maximum volume and hold. </p><p> 2. Use the right amount of product: Less is more when it comes to mousse. Start with a small amount and add more as needed. Too much mousse can weigh the hair down and make it look greasy. </p><p> 3. Apply the mousse evenly: Work the product through your hair from roots to ends, making sure to distribute it evenly. This will ensure that every strand of hair gets the volume and hold it needs. </p><p> 4. Style as desired: Once the mousse is applied, you can style your hair as desired. Use a round brush and a blow dryer to add extra volume, or use your fingers to create a more tousled look. </p><h4>Best Mousse for Short Fine Hair UK: Frequently Asked Questions</h4><p> 1.
