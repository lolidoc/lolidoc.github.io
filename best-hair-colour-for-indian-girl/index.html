The answer to this question may vary depending on individual preferences, skin tone, and hair type. However, there are a few hair colours that tend to work well for most Indian girls. These include shades of brown, burgundy, and black. These colours not only complement our skin tones but also enhance our natural beauty.</p><p>In conclusion, the best hair colour for Indian girls is one that complements their skin tone, enhances their natural beauty, and is gentle on their hair.
