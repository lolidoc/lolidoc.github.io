First and foremost, you want to choose a style that softens your facial structure and adds feminine curves. Avoid hairstyles that accentuate your angular features or make your face look boxier.</p><p>One of the most flattering hairstyles for square face shape is a layered cut.

Layers can be added to both long and short hair, so you have plenty of options to choose from.</p><p>Another great hairstyle for square face shape is long waves.

Whether you choose a layered cut, long waves, or side-swept bangs, the right hairstyle can make all the difference in enhancing your natural beauty and boosting your confidence.</p><h2>The History and Myth of the Best Hairstyle for Square Face Shape</h2><p>The concept of finding the best hairstyle for different face shapes has been around for centuries. In ancient times, people believed that certain hairstyles could enhance or diminish certain facial features. This belief was based on the idea that a person's face shape could reveal aspects of their personality and character.</p><p>Throughout history, different cultures have had their own ideas about what constitutes the best hairstyle for square face shape. For example, in ancient Egypt, women with square faces were often depicted with long, flowing hair and elaborate headdresses. This style was believed to enhance their beauty and emphasize their regal status.</p><p>In more recent history, the concept of face shape and hairstyling has become more scientific. Hairstylists and beauty experts have developed guidelines and techniques for determining the best hairstyle for different face shapes. These guidelines take into account factors such as the shape of the face, the angles of the jawline, and the placement of the cheekbones.</p><p>While there may be some truth to the idea that certain hairstyles can enhance or diminish certain facial features, it's important to remember that beauty is subjective. The best hairstyle for square face shape is one that makes you feel confident and beautiful, regardless of what the guidelines say.</p><h2>The Hidden Secret of the Best Hairstyle for Square Face Shape</h2><p>The hidden secret of finding the best hairstyle for square face shape is to experiment and try different styles. What works for one person may not work for another, so it's important to find a hairstyle that suits your individual features and personal style.</p><p>One way to find the perfect hairstyle for square face shape is to consult with a professional hairstylist. They have the knowledge and expertise to help you determine which styles will be most flattering for your face shape. They can also provide you with tips and tricks for maintaining your new hairstyle and keeping it looking its best.</p><p>Another hidden secret is to consider your hair texture and thickness when choosing a hairstyle. Different hair types require different styling techniques and products, so it's important to find a style that works well with your natural hair type. This will help to ensure that your hairstyle looks effortless and natural.</p><p>Ultimately, the hidden secret of finding the best hairstyle for square face shape is to embrace your unique features and find a style that makes you feel confident and beautiful.

Shorter hairstyles, on the other hand, can accentuate your angular features and make your face look boxier.</p><p>Secondly, it's important to consider the placement of your part.
