With the right haircut, you can enhance your facial features and make a bold statement. In this article, we will explore some trendy and stylish mens hairstyles that are perfect for those with thick hair and an oval face shape.</p><h3>The Classic Pompadour</h3><p>The classic pompadour is a timeless hairstyle that suits almost every face shape. For men with thick hair and an oval face, this hairstyle can add volume and height to your hair, creating a stylish and sophisticated look. To achieve the pompadour, you will need to have longer hair on top and shorter sides. Use a strong-hold pomade or gel to style your hair upwards and back, creating a sleek and polished finish.</p><h3>The Undercut</h3><p>The undercut is a popular hairstyle that works well for men with thick hair and an oval face shape. This hairstyle features short sides and a longer top, creating a stylish contrast. The undercut can be styled in various ways, such as slicked back, textured, or with a side part. It is a versatile hairstyle that can be easily customized to suit your personal style and preference.</p><h3>The Messy Quiff</h3><p>If you prefer a more casual and relaxed look, the messy quiff is a great option. This hairstyle works well for men with thick hair as it adds texture and volume to your hair. To achieve the messy quiff, apply a styling product to your damp hair and use your fingers to tousle and lift your hair upwards. This will create a messy and effortless look that is perfect for any casual occasion.</p><h3>The Textured Crop</h3><p>The textured crop is a trendy and low-maintenance hairstyle that works well for men with thick hair and an oval face shape. This hairstyle features short and textured hair on top, with slightly longer hair on the sides. The textured crop adds dimension and movement to your hair, creating a stylish and modern look. To style, simply apply a matte styling product to your hair and use your fingers to create texture and definition.</p><h3>The Side Swept Fringe</h3><p>If you want to add some style to your thick hair, consider the side swept fringe. This hairstyle features longer hair on top that is swept to one side, creating a stylish and sophisticated look. The side swept fringe works well for men with an oval face shape as it adds softness and balance to your facial features. To style, use a blow dryer and a round brush to sweep your hair to the side, and finish with a light-hold hairspray to keep it in place.</p><h3>The Buzz Cut</h3><p>If you prefer a low-maintenance hairstyle, the buzz cut is a great option for men with thick hair and an oval face shape. This hairstyle features short hair all over, creating a clean and minimalist look. The buzz cut is easy to maintain and requires minimal styling. Simply visit your barber regularly to keep your hair short and neat.</p><h3>The Faux Hawk</h3><p>The faux hawk is a stylish and edgy hairstyle that works well for men with thick hair. This hairstyle features short hair on the sides and a longer strip of hair in the middle that is styled upwards. The faux hawk adds height and volume to your hair, creating a bold and confident look. To style, apply a strong-hold styling product to your hair and use your fingers to create the desired shape and height.</p><h3>The Classic Side Part</h3><p>The classic side part is a timeless and elegant hairstyle that suits men with thick hair and an oval face shape. This hairstyle features a deep side part and longer hair on top that is combed to the side. The classic side part adds a touch of sophistication and suits both formal and casual occasions. To achieve this look, use a fine-tooth comb and a styling product to create a clean and polished side part.</p><h3>The Long Wavy Hairstyle</h3><p>If you have longer hair and want to embrace your natural waves, the long wavy hairstyle is a great choice. This hairstyle works well for men with thick hair and an oval face shape as it adds movement and texture to your hair. To style, apply a curl-enhancing product to your damp hair and scrunch it with your fingers. Let your hair air dry or use a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer to enhance the waves.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>When it comes to mens hairstyles for thick hair and an oval face shape, the options are endless. Whether you prefer a classic and polished look or a more casual and edgy style, there is a hairstyle that will suit your personal taste and enhance your facial features. Experiment with different cuts, lengths, and styling techniques to find the perfect hairstyle that reflects your individuality and makes you feel confident and stylish.</p></article>
