This short and chic style is easy to maintain and can be customized to suit your individual taste. Another trendy option is the bob, which can be worn straight or with curls for added volume. For those with longer hair, layers can help to add movement and body.</p><h2>Best Hairstyles for Over 60 in 2021: Personal Experience</h2><p>As a woman over 60 myself, I understand the challenges of finding a hairstyle that is both flattering and age-appropriate.
