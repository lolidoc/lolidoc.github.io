I wasn't sure if the wig would look natural or if it would be comfortable to wear. However, after doing some research and following the proper steps, I was pleasantly surprised with the results.</p><p>One of the key things I learned was the importance of properly prepping my natural hair before putting on the wig.

I also made sure to apply a heat protectant spray and use a straightener to create a sleek base for the wig to sit on.</p><p>Next, I carefully braided my hair close to my scalp to create a flat surface for the wig to sit on. This not only helped the wig to look more natural, but it also made it easier to secure in place. I then carefully put on the wig, adjusting it to my desired style and fit. I was surprised at how comfortable and secure it felt once it was on.</p><p>The first time I wore the short wig, I received so many compliments! People couldn't believe that it wasn't my real hair.

It allowed me to achieve a fresh and fashionable look without the hassle of dealing with my long hair. I would highly recommend giving it a try if you're looking to change up your style or save time getting ready in the morning.</p><h2>What is a Short Wig with Long Thick Hair?</h2><p>A short wig with long thick hair is a wig that is designed to be worn by individuals with long, thick natural hair.
