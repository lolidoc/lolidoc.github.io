I remember when I first decided to embrace my natural hair and cut it short. I was excited about the newfound freedom and versatility that came with my shorter hair, but I also had to learn how to work with my new length.</p><p>One of my favorite go-to styles for very short natural black hair is the wash-and-go. This style is perfect for those days when you want to show off your natural curls and don't have much time to spend on styling. To achieve a wash-and-go, simply wash and condition your hair, apply a leave-in conditioner or curl cream, and let your hair air dry or use a diffuser for added volume.</p><p>If you're looking for a more polished and defined look, you can try a twist-out or braid-out. To achieve this style, start with freshly washed and conditioned hair. Section your hair into small sections and apply a twisting or braiding cream. Twist or braid each section, allow your hair to dry completely, and then carefully unravel the twists or braids for beautiful, defined curls.</p><p>Another fun and stylish option for very short natural black hair is the frohawk. This style combines the edginess of a mohawk with the natural beauty of your curls. To create a frohawk, start by parting your hair down the middle, leaving a small section of hair at the front. Use bobby pins or hair ties to pin up the sides of your hair, leaving the front section loose. Fluff and shape your curls for added volume and style.</p><p>Now that you have an idea of some simple and stylish options for styling very short natural black hair at home, it's time to experiment and find the styles that work best for you. Remember, the key is to embrace your natural texture and have fun with your hair.
