By learning how to cut teenage guys long hair yourself, you can save time and money while also ensuring that your son's hair looks exactly how he wants it.</p><p>To start, gather the necessary tools - a pair of sharp scissors, a fine-toothed comb, and a spray bottle filled with water. Begin by dampening your son's hair with the spray bottle to make it easier to work with. Then, using the comb as a guide, section off the hair that you want to cut. Make sure to communicate with your son about how much length he wants to keep.</p><p>Next, using the scissors, trim the hair according to the desired length. It's important to work slowly and carefully, cutting small sections at a time. Remember, you can always cut more, but you can't put the hair back once it's been cut. Take breaks if needed and check in with your son throughout the process to ensure he is happy with the results.</p><p>In conclusion, cutting teenage guys long hair at home can be a cost-effective and convenient solution for both parents and their sons.
