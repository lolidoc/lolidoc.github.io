It also has antimicrobial properties that can help prevent scalp infections.</p><h3>Castor Oil:</h3><p>Castor oil is a popular ingredient in hair growth products due to its high concentration of ricinoleic acid. This fatty acid can help improve blood circulation to the scalp, promoting hair growth.</p><h3>Onion Juice:</h3><p>Onion juice is rich in sulfur, which is essential for the production of collagen and keratin, two proteins that are vital for hair growth. It can also help improve blood circulation to the scalp.</p><h3>Fenugreek Seeds:</h3><p>Fenugreek seeds are packed with nutrients that can nourish the hair follicles and promote healthy hair growth.
