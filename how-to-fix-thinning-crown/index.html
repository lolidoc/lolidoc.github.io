It can affect both men and women, and can be caused by a variety of factors such as genetics, hormonal changes, stress, and poor hair care practices. The good news is that there are several effective methods to address thinning crown and promote hair regrowth.</p><p>The first step in fixing thinning crown is to identify the underlying cause of the issue.
