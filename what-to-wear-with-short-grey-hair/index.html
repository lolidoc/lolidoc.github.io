When I first transitioned to grey hair, I found myself drawn to neutral colors like black, white, and shades of gray. These colors not only complemented my hair but also provided a chic and sophisticated look.</p><p>I also discovered that bold and vibrant colors such as red, royal blue, and emerald green created a stunning contrast with my grey hair. Wearing these colors made me feel confident and added a pop of excitement to my overall appearance. Additionally, I found that incorporating patterns and textures into my outfits added depth and interest to my look.</p><p>When it comes to styles, I found that short and structured pieces like blazers, tailored pants, and sheath dresses created a polished and put-together look. These pieces not only flattered my figure but also gave me a sense of empowerment and confidence.</p><p>Another important aspect to consider is accessorizing. I found that statement jewelry such as bold earrings or a chunky necklace added a touch of glamour to my outfits. Scarves and hats also became my go-to accessories, not only for their functionality but also for the added flair they brought to my overall look.</p><p>In conclusion, what to wear with short grey hair is a matter of personal preference and style.
