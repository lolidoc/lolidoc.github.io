I wanted a style that would soften the angles of my face and enhance my natural features. After doing some research and consulting with a hairstylist, I decided to go for a layered bob with side-swept bangs.</p><p>This haircut was perfect for my square face shape because it added softness and femininity to my features. The layers created movement and texture, while the side-swept bangs drew attention to my eyes and cheekbones. I instantly fell in love with my new look and received many compliments on how it complemented my face shape.</p><h2>What is a Square Face Shape?</h2><p>A square face shape is characterized by strong, angular features. The forehead, cheekbones, and jawline are all roughly the same width, giving the face a boxy appearance. People with square face shapes often have a more angular and defined jawline, which can create a masculine look. The key to finding the best short haircut for square face shape is to soften these strong angles and create a more balanced and feminine look.</p><h2>The History and Myth of the Best Short Haircut for Square Face Shape</h2><p>The concept of finding the best short haircut for square face shape has been around for centuries.

By opting for an asymmetrical cut, you can create visual interest and balance out the strong angles of a square face shape. This can be achieved through a side-swept fringe, an angled bob, or a pixie cut with longer bangs on one side.</p><h2>Recommendations for the Best Short Haircut for Square Face Shape</h2><p>When it comes to choosing the best short haircut for square face shape, there are a few recommendations to consider. First, opt for a haircut that adds softness and femininity to the face. This can be achieved through layers, texture, and asymmetrical cuts. Second, consider your hair texture and thickness.
