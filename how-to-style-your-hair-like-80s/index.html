From big, teased hair to wild curls, 80s hairstyles were all about making a statement. If you want to bring back the retro vibes and style your hair like they did in the 80s, you've come to the right place. In this article, we'll take a trip down memory lane and explore the secrets behind those fabulous 80s hairstyles.</p><p>Many people are fascinated by the hairstyles of the 80s, but they often struggle to recreate the look on their own. The big hair, the volume, and the wildness can seem intimidating. However, with the right techniques and a little bit of practice, anyone can achieve that 80s vibe in their hair.</p><p>To style your hair like they did in the 80s, you'll need a few essential tools and products. First, invest in a good quality hairspray that provides strong hold. This will help you achieve the volume and height that was characteristic of 80s hairstyles. You'll also need a teasing comb or brush to create the signature teased look, as well as a curling iron or hot rollers to add curls and waves to your hair.</p><p>In summary, to achieve an authentic 80s hairstyle, you'll need a good hairspray, a teasing comb, and a curling iron or hot rollers. These tools will help you create the volume, height, and curls that are essential for an 80s look.</p><h2>How to Style Your Hair Like 80s: A Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>If you're ready to bring back the 80s in your hair, follow this step-by-step guide:</p><h2>Step 1: Start with Clean, Dry Hair</h2><p>Before you begin styling your hair, make sure it's clean and dry. Wash and condition your hair as usual, and then blow dry it completely. You want to start with a clean canvas for your 80s hairstyle.</p><h2>Step 2: Prep Your Hair with Heat Protectant</h2><p>Before using any hot tools on your hair, it's important to protect it from heat damage. Apply a heat protectant spray or cream to your hair, focusing on the ends and any areas that will be exposed to heat.</p><h2>Step 3: Tease Your Hair for Volume</h2><p>To create the volume that is characteristic of 80s hairstyles, you'll need to tease your hair. Take small sections of hair near the crown of your head and backcomb them using a teasing comb or brush. This will create the height and fullness that was popular in the 80s.</p><h2>Step 4: Curl or Wave Your Hair</h2><p>Once you've teased your hair, it's time to add some curls or waves. Depending on your hair length and desired style, you can use a curling iron or hot rollers to achieve the look. Take small sections of hair and wrap them around the curling iron or hot rollers, holding for a few seconds before releasing. Continue this process until all of your hair is curled or waved.</p><h2>Step 5: Set Your Style with Hairspray</h2><p>To ensure that your 80s hairstyle stays in place all day, finish off with a generous amount of hairspray. Spray the hairspray all over your hair, focusing on the roots and any areas that need extra hold. This will help your style last and maintain its volume and shape.</p><h3>Conclusion of How to Style Your Hair Like 80s</h3><p>Styling your hair like they did in the 80s may seem daunting at first, but with the right tools and techniques, anyone can achieve that retro look. From big, teased hair to wild curls, 80s hairstyles were all about making a bold statement.
