Short natural hairstyles have gained popularity in recent years, as they offer a variety of benefits. Not only are they low-maintenance and time-saving, but they also highlight the unique texture and versatility of African American hair. In this article, we will explore some stunning images of African American short natural hairstyles that you can draw inspiration from.</p><h3>1. The Tapered Cut</h3><p>The tapered cut is a classic and timeless hairstyle that never fails to make a statement. This style features shorter hair at the back and sides, gradually getting longer towards the crown. It accentuates the natural shape of your face and showcases your beautiful facial features. The tapered cut can be worn with or without additional styling, making it perfect for those who prefer a fuss-free look.</p><h3>2. The Frohawk</h3><p>If you're looking to add some edge and personality to your hairstyle, the frohawk is the way to go. This style combines the elements of a traditional Mohawk and an afro, resulting in a bold and fierce look. You can style your hair into a high or low frohawk, depending on your preference. To achieve this style, simply gather the hair in the center and secure it with bobby pins or hair elastics.</p><h3>3. The Twist-Out</h3><p>The twist-out is a popular choice among African American women with short natural hair. It involves twisting small sections of your hair while it's damp, leaving them to dry overnight or using a diffuser. Once you unravel the twists, you're left with beautiful, defined curls that add volume and dimension to your hair. This style is versatile and can be worn for both casual and formal occasions.</p><h3>4. The Bantu Knots</h3><p>Bantu knots are a traditional African hairstyle that has been embraced by women all over the world. This style involves dividing your hair into small sections and twisting them into knots. Bantu knots can be worn as a protective style or left in overnight to create bouncy curls when unraveled. They are not only stylish but also help to retain moisture and promote hair growth.</p><h3>5. The Pixie Cut</h3><p>If you're looking for a short and chic hairstyle, the pixie cut is the perfect choice. This style involves cutting your hair short, usually around the ears or nape of the neck, and adding layers for added texture and movement. The pixie cut is easy to maintain and can be styled in various ways, such as sleek and smooth or tousled and messy. It's a bold and confident look that suits women of all ages.</p><h3>6. The Finger Coils</h3><p>Finger coils are a great way to enhance the natural curl pattern of your hair. This style involves twisting small sections of your hair around your finger to create defined coils. Finger coils can be done on damp or dry hair and can last for several days. They add volume and dimension to your hair, making it look fuller and more voluminous. This style is perfect for those who want to embrace their natural curls.</p><h3>7. The Afro Puff</h3><p>The afro puff is a versatile and stylish hairstyle that can be worn for any occasion. This style involves gathering your hair into a high or low ponytail and fluffing it out to create a voluminous puff. You can accessorize your afro puff with headbands, scarves, or flowers to add a touch of personality. It's a simple yet stunning hairstyle that celebrates the beauty of natural hair.</p><h3>8. The Mohawk</h3><p>The Mohawk is a bold and daring hairstyle that never fails to make a statement. This style involves shaving or cutting the sides of your hair short, while leaving the center section longer and styled upwards. The Mohawk can be worn with or without additional styling, such as braids or twists, to add more flair. It's a fierce and confident look that showcases your individuality.</p><h3>9. The Wash and Go</h3><p>If you're looking for an effortless and low-maintenance hairstyle, the wash and go is the way to go. This style involves washing your hair, applying a leave-in conditioner or curl defining product, and allowing your hair to air dry. The result is beautiful, defined curls that require minimal styling. The wash and go is perfect for those who are always on the go and don't have much time to spend on their hair.</p><h3>10. The Cornrows</h3><p>Cornrows are a classic and timeless hairstyle that has been passed down through generations. This style involves braiding your hair close to the scalp in intricate patterns. Cornrows can be worn in various styles, such as straight back, zig-zag, or curved designs. They not only look stylish but also help to protect your hair from damage and promote healthy growth. Cornrows can be worn for an extended period, making them a convenient choice for those with busy lifestyles.</p><p>In conclusion, African American short natural hairstyles are a beautiful and empowering way to embrace your natural hair texture. Whether you prefer a tapered cut, frohawk, twist-out, Bantu knots, pixie cut, finger coils, afro puff, Mohawk, wash and go, or cornrows, there are endless options to choose from. These hairstyles not only showcase your individuality but also celebrate the diversity and versatility of African American hair. So, go ahead and experiment with different styles to find the one that makes you feel confident and beautiful.</p></article>
