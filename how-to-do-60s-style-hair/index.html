The first step is to section your hair and tease the roots for volume. This is crucial in achieving that iconic 60s look. Once you have teased your hair, start curling it using hot rollers or a curling iron.</p><h2>What is 60s Style Hair?</h2><p>60s style hair refers to the iconic hairstyles popularized during the 1960s. This era was known for its bold and glamorous looks, with voluminous bouffants and sleek beehives being the go-to hairstyles. 60s style hair is characterized by its big, voluminous curls, teased roots, and glamorous updos.</p><p>To achieve the perfect 60s style hair, you'll need to master the art of teasing, curling, and setting your hair. It may take some practice, but with the right techniques and tools, you'll be able to recreate the iconic hairstyles of the era.</p><h2>History and Myth of 60s Style Hair</h2><p>The 60s was a time of revolution and change, and this was reflected in the hairstyles of the era. Women were breaking free from traditional beauty standards and embracing their individuality. The sleek beehives and voluminous bouffants became symbols of empowerment and self-expression.</p><p>However, there are also some myths surrounding 60s style hair. One common myth is that all women in the 60s had naturally thick and voluminous hair. In reality, many women used various techniques and products to achieve the desired look. Teasing, backcombing, and the use of hairpieces were common practices to create the illusion of volume.</p><h2>The Hidden Secret of 60s Style Hair</h2><p>The hidden secret to achieving the perfect 60s style hair lies in the art of teasing. Teasing, also known as backcombing, is the process of combing the hair towards the roots to create volume and texture. This technique is essential in achieving the iconic 60s hairstyles.</p><p>To tease your hair, start by sectioning it and spraying each section with hairspray. Take a small section of hair and hold it straight up. Using a teasing comb, comb the hair downwards towards the roots in short, quick strokes. Repeat this process for each section until you have achieved the desired volume.</p><h2>Recommendation for 60s Style Hair</h2><p>If you're looking for some inspiration for your 60s style hair, look no further than the iconic hairstyles of celebrities from the era. Brigitte Bardot, Audrey Hepburn, and Jackie Kennedy are just a few examples of women who rocked the 60s hairstyles with style and grace.</p><p>To achieve the perfect 60s style hair, invest in some good quality hot rollers or a curling iron. These tools will help you create those voluminous curls that are key to achieving the iconic 60s look. Don't forget to finish off your hairstyle with a generous amount of hairspray to ensure it stays in place all day long.</p><h3>How to Do 60s Style Hair: Step-by-Step Guide</h3><p>1. Section your hair and tease the roots to create volume. 2. Curl your hair using hot rollers or a curling iron. 3. Set the curls with hairspray and allow them to cool. 4.
