It can enhance your overall appearance and boost your confidence. However, not all hair types are created equal, and what may be attractive to one person may not be to another.</p><p>So, what type of hair is deemed more attractive? The answer is subjective and varies from person to person. Some may prefer long, flowing locks, while others may find short, edgy hairstyles more appealing.
