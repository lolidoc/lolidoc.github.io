The result was a chic and stylish look that I absolutely loved.</p><p>Short hair styles in 2021 are not only fashionable, but they are also practical. With a shorter length, I found that my hair was much easier to manage and style on a daily basis. I could simply wash and go, or add some texturizing spray for a more tousled and effortless look.

Additionally, short hair styles can be customized to suit your personal style and can be easily modified with different hair colors and highlights.</p><h2>Short Hair Style 2021: History and Myth</h2><p>The history of short hair styles dates back centuries, with various cultures and time periods embracing shorter lengths. In ancient Egypt, for example, both men and women would shave their heads and wear elaborate wigs as a symbol of beauty and status. In the 1920s, the iconic flapper style popularized short bobs and crops, breaking away from the traditional long hair styles of the time.</p><p>There is a common myth that short hair styles are only for certain face shapes or ages. However, this is not true. Short hair styles can be flattering for people of all ages and face shapes. The key is to find a style that suits your individual features and personal style.
