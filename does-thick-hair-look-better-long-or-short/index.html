The debate over whether thick hair looks better long or short is a common one, with passionate arguments on both sides. In this blog post, we will explore the pros and cons of each option, as well as provide some tips for styling and maintaining thick hair.</p><p>One of the main pain points related to deciding between long and short hair for thick hair is the difficulty of managing and styling it. Thick hair can be heavy and voluminous, making it challenging to keep it looking neat and tidy. Long hair can become tangled and unmanageable, while short hair may require frequent trims to maintain its shape.</p><p>So, does thick hair look better long or short?
