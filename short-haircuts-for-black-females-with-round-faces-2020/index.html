Bangs can be a great addition to a short haircut for a round face. Opt for side-swept bangs or wispy bangs that help to elongate your face shape. Avoid blunt bangs that cut across your forehead, as these can make your face appear wider.</p><h2>Q: How can I add volume to my short haircut for a round face?</h2><p>A: To add volume to your short haircut for a round face, try using a volumizing mousse or spray before styling. Blow-dry your hair upside down to create lift at the roots, and use a round brush to add volume while styling. You can also try using a teasing comb to gently backcomb the hair at the crown for added height.</p><h2>Q: Are there any short haircuts that should be avoided for a round face?</h2><p>A: While there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to haircuts, there are some styles that may not be as flattering for a round face. Avoid cuts that are too short or too long, as these can accentuate the roundness of your face. Additionally, avoid cuts with blunt ends or straight lines, as these can make your face appear wider.</p><h2>Q: How often should I get my short haircut trimmed?</h2><p>A: It is recommended to get your short haircut trimmed every 4-6 weeks to maintain the shape and style. Regular trims will help to prevent split ends and keep your hair looking healthy and fresh.</p></article>
