Finding the right haircut can make all the difference in taming your frizz and making your hair more manageable. </p><p> The best haircut for thick, frizzy hair is one that works with your natural texture and helps to reduce volume and frizz. A layered haircut is often recommended for thick, frizzy hair as it helps to distribute the weight of your hair and reduce the bulkiness. Additionally, a layered cut can add movement and shape to your hair, making it easier to style. </p><p> In summary, the best haircut for thick, frizzy hair is a layered cut that works with your natural texture to reduce volume and frizz.
